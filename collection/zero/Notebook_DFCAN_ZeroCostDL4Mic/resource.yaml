    description: Super-resolution via super-pixelisation. Deep Fourier channel attention
      network (DFCAN) is a network created to transform low-resolution (LR) images
      to super-resolved (SR) images, published by Qiao, Chang and Li, Di and Guo,
      Yuting and Liu, Chong and Jiang, Tao and Dai, Qionghai and Li, Dong. The training
      is done using LR-SR image pairs, taking the LR images as input and obtaining
      an output as close to SR as posible.
