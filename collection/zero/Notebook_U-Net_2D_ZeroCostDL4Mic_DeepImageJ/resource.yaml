    description: 2D binary segmentation. U-Net is an encoder-decoder architecture
      originally used for image segmentation. The first half of the U-Net architecture
      is a downsampling convolutional neural network which acts as a feature extractor
      from input images. The other half upsamples these results and restores an image
      by combining results from downsampling with the upsampled images. Note - visit
      the ZeroCostDL4Mic wiki to check the original publications this network is based
      on and make sure you cite these. Networks trained in this notebook can be used
      in Fiji via deepImageJ.
