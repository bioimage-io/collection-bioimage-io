    description: Paired image-to-image translation of 3D images. Label-free Prediction
      (fnet) is a neural network used to infer the features of cellular structures
      from brightfield or EM images without coloured labels. The network is trained
      using paired training images from the same field of view, imaged in a label-free
      (e.g. brightfield) and labelled condition (e.g. fluorescent protein). When trained,
      this allows the user to identify certain structures from brightfield images
      alone. The performance of fnet may depend significantly on the structure at
      hand. Note - visit the ZeroCostDL4Mic wiki to check the original publications
      this network is based on and make sure you cite these.
