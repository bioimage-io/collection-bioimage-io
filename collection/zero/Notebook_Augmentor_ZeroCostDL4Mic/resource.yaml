    description: Artificially increase the size of your training dataset. Augmentor
      is a data augmentation library. Data augmentation can improve training progress
      by amplifying differences in the dataset. This can be useful if the available
      dataset is small since, in this case, it is possible that a network could quickly
      learn every example in the dataset (overfitting), without augmentation. Augmentation
      can be especially valuable when training dataset need to be manually labelled.
      Note - visit the ZeroCostDL4Mic wiki to check the original publications this
      network is based on and make sure you cite these.
