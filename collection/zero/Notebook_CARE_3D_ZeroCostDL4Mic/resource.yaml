    description: Supervised restoration of 3D images. CARE is a neural network capable
      of image restoration from corrupted bio-images, first published in 2018 by Weigert
      et al. in Nature Methods. The network allows image denoising and resolution
      improvement in 2D and 3D images, in a supervised training manner. The function
      of the network is essentially determined by the set of images provided in the
      training dataset. For instance, if noisy images are provided as input and high
      signal-to-noise ratio images are provided as targets, the network will perform
      denoising. Note - visit the ZeroCostDL4Mic wiki to check the original publications
      this network is based on and make sure you cite these.
