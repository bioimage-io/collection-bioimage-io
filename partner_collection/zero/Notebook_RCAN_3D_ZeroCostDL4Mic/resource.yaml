    description: Supervised restoration of 3D images. RCAN is a neural network capable
      of image restoration from corrupted bio-images. The network allows image denoising
      and resolution improvement in 3D images, in a supervised training manner. The
      function of the network is essentially determined by the set of images provided
      in the training dataset. For instance, if noisy images are provided as input
      and high signal-to-noise ratio images are provided as targets, the network will
      perform denoising. Note - visit the ZeroCostDL4Mic wiki to check the original
      publications this network is based on and make sure you cite these.
