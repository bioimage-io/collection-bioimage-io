    description: Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) image reconstruction
      from high-density emitter data. Deep-STORM is a neural network capable of image
      reconstruction from high-density single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM),
      first published in 2018 by Nehme et al. in Optica. This network allows image
      reconstruction of 2D super-resolution images, in a supervised training manner.
      The network is trained using simulated high-density SMLM data for which the
      ground-truth is available. These simulations are obtained from random distribution
      of single molecules in a field-of-view and therefore do not imprint structural
      priors during training. The network output a super-resolution image with increased
      pixel density (typically upsampling factor of 8 in each dimension). Note - visit
      the ZeroCostDL4Mic wiki to check the original publications this network is based
      on and make sure you cite these. Networks trained in this notebook can be used
      in Fiji via deepImageJ and ThunderSTORM plugin.
