    description: Joint denoising and binary segmentation of 2D images. DenoiSeg 2D
      is deep-learning method that can be used to jointly denoise and segment 2D microscopy
      images. The benefits of using DenoiSeg (compared to other Deep Learning-based
      segmentation methods) are more prononced when only a few annotated images are
      available. However, the denoising part requires many images to perform well.
      All the noisy images don't need to be labeled to train DenoiSeg. Note - visit
      the ZeroCostDL4Mic wiki to check the original publications this network is based
      on and make sure you cite these.
