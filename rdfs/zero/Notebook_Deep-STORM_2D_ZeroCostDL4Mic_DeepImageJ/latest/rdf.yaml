description: Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) image reconstruction from
  high-density emitter data. Deep-STORM is a neural network capable of image reconstruction
  from high-density single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), first published
  in 2018 by Nehme et al. in Optica. This network allows image reconstruction of 2D
  super-resolution images, in a supervised training manner. The network is trained
  using simulated high-density SMLM data for which the ground-truth is available.
  These simulations are obtained from random distribution of single molecules in a
  field-of-view and therefore do not imprint structural priors during training. The
  network output a super-resolution image with increased pixel density (typically
  upsampling factor of 8 in each dimension). Note - visit the ZeroCostDL4Mic wiki
  to check the original publications this network is based on and make sure you cite
  these. Networks trained in this notebook can be used in Fiji via deepImageJ and
  ThunderSTORM plugin.
